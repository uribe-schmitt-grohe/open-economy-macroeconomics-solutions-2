In addition, each period \\(t = 0, 1, \\ldots\\) the household is endowed with an exogenous and stochastic amount of goods \\(y_t\\).

    "text": "Problem\nThroughout this chapter, we have studied small open economies in which the world interest rate is given. This exercise aims at illustrating the forces determining this variable.\nConsider a two-period world composed of a continuum of countries indexed by \\(i \\in [0, 1]\\). Each country is populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by\n\\[\n\\ln(c_{i1}) + \\beta \\ln(c_{i2}),\n\\]\nwhere \\(c_{i1}\\) and \\(c_{i2}\\) denote consumption of a perishable good in country \\(i\\) in periods 1 and 2, respectively, and \\(\\beta \\in (0, 1)\\) is the subjective discount factor. Households start period 1 with a nil net debt position. In period 1, they can borrow or lend in the international financial market via a debt instrument, denoted \\(d_{i1}\\), that matures in period 2 and carries the interest rate \\(r\\). The interest rate \\(r\\) is exogenous to each country \\(i\\).\nIn period 1, each household receives an endowment of goods \\(y_{i1} = y_1 + \\varepsilon_i\\), where \\(y_1\\) is the world component of the endowment and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is a country-specific component satisfying\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 \\varepsilon_i di = 0.\n\\]\nIn period 2, the endowment has no idiosyncratic component and is given by \\(y_{i2} = y_2\\). Finally, households are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint that forbids them to end period 2 with a positive debt position, that is, they are subject to the constraint \\(d_{i2} \\leq 0\\), where \\(d_{i2}\\) denotes the debt assumed in period 2.\n\nWrite down and solve the household’s optimization problem in country \\(i\\), given \\(r\\).\nDerive the equilibrium levels of the trade balance, the current account, and external debt in periods 1 and 2 in country \\(i\\) given \\(r\\).\nWrite down the world resource constraints in periods 1 and 2.\nDerive the equilibrium level of the world interest rate, \\(r\\).\nSuppose now that output in period 1 in country \\(i\\) increases by \\(x &gt; 0\\), that is, \\(\\Delta y_{i1} = x\\). Derive the effect of this shock on the trade balance and the level of external debt in period 1 in country \\(i\\) and on the world interest rate under the following two alternative cases:\n(a) A country-specific endowment shock, \\(\\Delta y_{i1} = \\Delta \\varepsilon_i = x\\) and \\(\\Delta y_1 = 0\\).\n(b) A world endowment shock, \\(\\Delta y_{i1} = \\Delta y_1 = x\\), and \\(\\Delta \\varepsilon_i = 0\\).\nProvide a discussion of your results."

The interest rate falls to make consumption tomorrow more costly and making it optimal to consume tomorrow less than will be consumed today.\nIn the reverse case, the interest rate is high to make consumption today more costly and make it optimal to consume more tomorrow.\nNote that in this case only “shocks to the aggregate income” matter for the value of the interest rate and whether the consumption is perfectly smoothed across periods.\n\n\n5.\nTwo cases:\n(a) The world interest rate does not depend on the country-level shocks, therefore, the interest rate stays the same.\nRecall from the previous section that country-level debt can be expressed as:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nThat means that if country-specific component increases, external debt decreases.\nSince:\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account both increase.\n(b) consider the equation for the world interest rate:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{y_2}{\\beta y_1} - 1\n\\]\nThe world interest rate depends negatively on \\(y_1\\), therefore, it will decrease when \\(y_1\\) increases.\nThe external debt of a country \\(i\\) is given by:\n\\[\nd_1^i = \\frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \\beta)} \\left( y_2^i - \\beta(1 + r)y_1^i \\right)\n\\]\nReplace the interest rate in terms of aggregate income to obtain:\n\\[\nd_1^i = - \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTherefore, country debt will not change.\n\\[\ntb_1^i = ca_1^i = -d_1^i = \\frac{\\beta \\varepsilon_1^i}{1 + \\beta}\n\\]\nTrade balance and current account will not change as well.\nComparison: When the world component of the output increases, the whole world would like to save to ensure consumption smoothing. However, because there is no additional demand for funds, the interest rate goes down to ensure that the world market for savings clears. Consumption in period 2 becomes more expensive and consumers find it optimal consume all the additional income.\nIn the case of the country-specific shock, only one country wants to save more. All the countries are infinitely small, so there is no impact on the world interest rate."

    "text": "Problem\nIn Chapter 1, we showed that two empirical regularities that characterize emerging economies are the countercyclicality of the trade balance-to-output ratio and the fact that consumption growth appears to be more volatile than output growth. In this chapter, we developed a simple small open endowment economy and provided intuitive arguments suggesting that this economy fails to account for these two stylized facts. However, that model does not allow for closed-form solutions of second moments of output growth, consumption growth, or the trade balance-to-output ratio. The goal of this exercise is to obtain these implied statistics numerically.\nTo this end, consider the following parameterization of the model developed in the present chapter:\n\\[\ny_t - \\bar{y} = \\rho(y_{t-1} - \\bar{y}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\rho=0.9\\), \\(\\bar{y}=1\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.03. Note that the parameter \\(\\bar{y}\\), which earlier in this chapter was implicitly assumed to be zero, represents the deterministic steady state of the output process. Assume further that \\(r=\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1=0.1\\), \\(d_{-1}=\\bar{y}/2\\), and \\(y_{-1}=\\bar{y}\\).\n\nSimulate the economy for 100 years.\nDiscard the first 50 years of artificial data to minimize the dependence of the results on initial conditions.\nCompute the growth rates of output and consumption and the trade balance-to-output ratio.\nCompute the sample standard deviations of output growth and consumption growth and the correlation between output growth and the trade balance-to-output ratio.

In fact debt turns into assets and then grows without bounds but at a rate less that \\(r\\).\nAsymptotically the growth rate of assets (\\(-d_t\\)) is\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\frac{(-d_t) - (-d_{t-1})}{-d_{t-1}} = \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\left( \\frac{y - r d_{t-1}}{-d_{t-1}} \\right)\n= r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right]\n\\]\nwhich uses \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} y / d_{t-1} = 0\\) because \\(-d_{t-1}\\) increases without bound.\nThe gross growth rate of \\(-d_t\\) is equal to \\(1 + r \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] = (1 + r) / (1 + \\gamma) &lt; 1 + r\\).\nThe growth rate of consumption is \\(\\beta^{-1} = (1 + r)/(1 + \\gamma)\\), which is the same as the asymptotic growth rate of assets.\n\n\n5.\nStep 1: Change in consumption in period 0\n\\[\n\\Delta c_0 = \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\Delta y &lt; \\Delta y\n\\]\nbecause \\(\\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) &lt; 1\\).\nThis follows from \\(\\beta = (1 + \\gamma)/(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIn words \\(c_0\\) increases but by less than \\(y\\).\nStep 2:\n\\[\n\\Delta tb_0 = \\Delta y - \\Delta c_0 = \\left[ 1 - \\left( \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + \\gamma} \\right) \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\right] \\Delta y &gt; 0\n\\]\nThis means that a permanent increase in the level of income leads to an increase in the trade balance.\nUnder the preferences used in class, namely, time separable and no impatience, we obtained the result that the trade balance was unchanged.\nWhat is the intuition? With Leontief preferences and agents more patient than the market (\\(\\beta &gt; 1/(1 + \\gamma)\\)) households have an increasing path of consumption over time and to achieve this given that the increase in income is flat (or non-increasing over time), the only way to fund an increasing consumption path is to save more in period 0 and then to use only part of the additional interest income for additional consumption and using the remainder to save.\n\n\n6.\nWhen \\(\\gamma = 0\\), no equilibrium with positive lifetime utility exists."

This internalization is absent under external habits, so household consume more in period 1 under the latter formulation.\nIt is of interest to note that period-1 consumption is lower under external habits than under no habits.

Then consider an endowment economy with \\(b_{-1} = 0\\) and \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\). Analyze whether the response of consumption in period 0 is equal in size to the anticipated rate cut and whether it depends on the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). In particular, do anticipated interest rate cuts have a smaller stimulating effect on current consumption the further in the future they will take place, that is, the larger \\(t^*\\) is? Provide intuition for your findings.\nRelate the insights obtained in this exercise to the debate on Forward Guidance as a monetary policy strategy. In particular, interpret the present real economy as a monetary economy with rigid nominal prices and a central bank that deploys the necessary monetary policy to fully control the real interest rate \\(r_t\\). Address in particular the question of whether forward guidance is an effective tool to stimulate aggregate demand."

Note that \\(\\prod_{s=0}^{-1} (1 + r_{t+s})\\) represents the empty product because the lower bound \\(s = 0\\) is greater than the upper bound \\(s = -1\\). By convention, an empty product (a product over an empty index set) is defined to be 1.\n\n\n2.\nTo derive the equilibrium paths we first write the Lagrangian for the consumer\n\\[\n\\mathcal{L} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t \\left\\{ \\ln c_t + \\lambda_t \\left[ y_t + b_{t-1} - c_t - \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} \\right] \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThis Lagrangian has first order conditions with respect to \\(c_t\\) and \\(b_{t+1}\\) respectively\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{c_t} = \\lambda_t\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{\\lambda_t}{1 + r_t} = \\beta \\lambda_{t+1}.\n\\]\nAn equilibrium is paths \\(\\{c_t, b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) such that for all \\(t \\geq 0\\) we have the combined first order conditions, sequential budget constraint, and the no-Ponzi game condition\n\\[\nc_{t+1} = \\beta(1 + r_t)c_t \\tag{2}\n\\]\n\\[\nc_t + \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} = y_t + b_{t-1} \\tag{3}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\lim_{j \\to \\infty} \\frac{b_{t+j}}{\\prod_{s=0}^j (1 + r_{t+s})} = 0 \\tag{4}\n\\]\ngiven \\(\\{r_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), \\(\\{y_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\), and \\(b_{-1}\\).\nEquivalently, equilibrium is a \\(c_0\\) such that\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta)b_{-1} + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right). \\tag{5}\n\\]\nTo see this, iterate (2) backwards to obtain\n\\[\nc_t = \\beta^t \\left( \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s) \\right) c_0. \\tag{6}\n\\]\nRearranging yields\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\beta^t c_0.\n\\]\nNow sum both sides from \\(t=0\\) to \\(t=T\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{T} \\beta^t c_0\n\\]\nTake limit for \\(T \\rightarrow \\infty\\)\n\\[\n\\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{c_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t c_0 = \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0\n\\]\nNext use this expression in equation (1) evaluated for \\(t = 0\\) to obtain\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{1 - \\beta}c_0 = b_{-1} + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right)\n\\]\nFinally, multiply by \\((1− \\beta)\\), which yields the equation (5).\nHow to find the associated path of \\(b_t\\) and \\(c_t\\)? Use (3) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(b_0\\). Then use (5) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(c_1\\). With \\(b_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) in hand evaluate (3) for \\(t = 1\\) to obtain \\(b_1\\). Continue in this way to construct the sequences \\(\\{c_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) and \\(\\{b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\).\n\n\n3.\nStorage economy, \\(y = 0\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\)\n\\[\n\\frac{c_t'}{c_t} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for all } t \\leq t^* \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}'}{1 + r_{t^*}} \\right) &lt; 1 & \\text{for all } t &gt; t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis shows that the anticipated future rate cut does not stimulate demand at the time it is announced. Importantly, there is no effect on current consumption regardless of the anticipation horizon \\(t^*\\). But the rate cut will permanently lower future consumption starting from the period it takes place. Intuition: The rate cut has a SE whereby current consumption rises and future consumption falls. But it also has an IE. Here the IE is negative because the positive stock of bonds will pay lower interest in the future. With log utility, the SE exactly cancels the IE effect and the future rate cut fails to stimulate the current economy.\nEndowment Economy: \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} = 0\\).\nLet\n\\[\nq_{0,t} \\equiv \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s); \\quad \\text{and } q_{0,t}' = \\prod_{s=0}^{t-1} (1 + r_s')\n\\]\nUse (5) to obtain\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0 &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nc_0' &= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}'} \\right) \\\\\n&= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = 0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) + (1 - \\beta) \\cdot \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nso that\n\\[\nc_0' - c_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t = t^* + 1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right) \\left[ \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}'} - 1 \\right] &gt; 0\n\\]\nWhat is different now? Why does consumption go up on impact in response to the future rate cut? There is a positive IE associated with the expected future rate cut. Why? Because of the rate cut in \\(t^*\\), the PDV of endowment stream is higher. Thus, the SE and the IE reinforce each other for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) and pull in opposite directions for \\(t &gt; t^*\\).\nSize of increase in consumption for \\(t \\leq t^*\\) now depends on \\(t^*\\). The further in the future is the rate cut, the smaller is the positive IE and hence the smaller is increase in demand.\n\n\n4.\nBy contrast in the NK model, increase in consumption depends only on size of rate cut, but not on anticipation horizon, i.e., a rate cut in 100 years has same power as a rate cut in 1 year from now and hence there is no Forward Guidance puzzle. In the current environment Forward Guidance is a less effective tool to stimulate the economy than in the NK model."

The first-order condition associated with this problem is\n\\[\n\\beta^t c_t^{-1} = \\lambda (1 + r)^{-t},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), where \\(\\lambda\\) is an endogenously determined constant. This expression implies that\n\\[\n\\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1,\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 0\\), which, in turn, implies that\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0.\n\\]\nPlugging these two results in the intertemporal resource constraint derived above gives\n\\[\n0 = \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} \\left\\{ y - [\\beta(1 + r)]^t c_0 \\right\\}\n= y \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} (1 + r)^{-t} - c_0 \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\beta^t\n= \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - \\frac{1}{1 - \\beta} c_0,\n\\]\nwhich implies the following solution for the initial level of consumption:\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y &gt; y.\n\\]\nRecall that \\(y\\) is the constant equilibrium path of consumption under the more standard assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\). Thus, summing up, we have that when \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\), consumption is initially higher than its equilibrium value under the assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\), and then gradually falls to zero at the gross rate \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIntuitively, households in this economy are impatient relative to the market discount factor \\(1/(1 + r)\\), and, as a result, consume a lot at the beginning and nothing at the ‘end’ of their never-ending lives. A story similar to that in the 1995 movie Leaving Las Vegas, but in infinite horizon.\n\n\n2.\nIn period 0, we have that\n\\[\nd_0 = c_0 - y = \\frac{y}{r} - \\beta \\frac{1 + r}{r} y.\n\\]\nWe calculated before that \\(c_0 &gt; y\\), so we have that \\(d_0 &gt; 0 = d_{-1}\\). Thus, debt increases in period 0.\nNow consider the long run. Taking the limit of the left- and right-hand sides of the sequential resource constraint for \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we get\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = (1 + r) \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t + \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t - y.\n\\]\nRecalling that \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0\\), we obtain\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = \\frac{y}{r} &gt; d_0.\n\\]\nThe long-run value of debt is higher than its value in period 0. It can be shown that the convergence is monotonic and dictated by the equation\n\\[\nd_t = \\frac{y}{r} \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{t+1} \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe proof is by induction. We already showed that it holds for \\(t = 0\\), that is,\n\\[\nd_0 = \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{1+0} \\right\\} \\frac{y}{r}.\n\\]\nSuppose it holds for an arbitrary \\(t \\geq 0\\), then we need to show it also holds for \\(t + 1\\). By the budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{t+1} &= (1 + r) d_t + c_{t+1} - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_t + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+1} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+1} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} - y \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+2} (1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSuppose one had been unsure that debt converges to a constant, the above solution for \\(d_t\\) also shows it.\n\n\n3.\nThe trade balance is defined as \\(tb_t = y - c_t\\). The initial trade balance is negative, since, as shown above, \\(c_0 &gt; y\\). Since consumption is monotonically decreasing, we have that the trade balance improves monotonically. At some point it turns into a surplus. In the long run, the trade balance equals the endowment \\(y\\)."

It says that after deteriorating in period 0, the trade balance improves to a level higher than in the original steady state.\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 - tb_{-1} &lt; 0\\). Because the trade balance is constant (and equal to \\(tb''\\)) from period 1 on, we have that the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r) d_{t-1} - tb''; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nThe only nonexplosive solution to this expression is\n\\[\nd_t = d_0; \\quad t \\geq 1\n\\]\nwhich means that\n\\[\ntb'' = r d_0 &gt; r \\bar{d}\n\\]\nThis explains the last line of (*). Summarizing,\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &gt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0 and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n2.\nThe key difference is that under a permanent but anticipated increase in productivity, output does not increase in period 0. This is because at \\(t = 0\\) \\(A_t\\) and \\(k_t\\) are still at their old values \\(\\bar{A}\\) and \\(\\bar{k}\\). In the unanticipated case, by contrast, \\(A_0 = A' &gt; \\bar{A}\\) and \\(k_0 = \\bar{k}\\), so output increases in period 0. Besides this, the two cases are similar in the sense that in period 0 consumption and investment increase, and the trade balance deteriorates.\n\n\n3.\n\n(a)\nFrom the equilibrium condition \\(k_{t+1} = \\kappa(A_{t+1}/r)\\), we have that \\(k_t = \\bar{k} \\equiv \\kappa(\\bar{A}/r)\\) for \\(t \\leq 0\\), \\(k_1 = k' \\equiv \\kappa(A'/r)\\), and \\(k_t = \\bar{k}\\) for \\(t &gt; 1\\). So we have that\n\\[\nk_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{k} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t = 0 \\\\\nk' &gt; \\bar{k} & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{k} & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ni_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nk' - \\bar{k} &gt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n\\bar{k} - k' &lt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\\[\ny_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t = 0 \\\\\nA'F(k') &gt; y_0 & t = 1 \\\\\n\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nFrom the intertemporal resource constraint and the fact that \\(c_t = c_0\\) for all \\(t\\) we have:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nrd_{-1} + c_0 &= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t F(k_t) - (k_{t+1} - k_t)}{(1 + r)^t}\\\\\n&= \\frac{r}{1 + r} \\left[ \\left( \\frac{1 + r}{r} \\right) \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})) - (k' - \\bar{k}) + \\frac{1}{1 + r}(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - r(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&= rd_{-1} + c_{-1} + \\frac{r}{(1 + r)^2} \\left[ A'F(\\bar{k}) - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + A'F(k') - A'F(\\bar{k})- A'F'(k')(k' - \\bar{k}) \\right]\\\\\n&&gt; rd_{-1} + c_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nwhich implies that\n\\[\nc_0 &gt; c_{-1}\n\\]\nthat is, consumption jumps up in period 0 and stays at that higher level thereafter. Comparing this derivation with the one for an anticipated permanent productivity shock, it is clear that the increase in consumption is now smaller. The trade balance deteriorates in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\ntb_0 - tb_{-1} = (y_0 - y_{-1}) - (c_0 - c_{-1}) - (i_0 - i_{-1})\n\\]\nand note that \\(y_0 - y_{-1} = 0\\), \\(c_0 - c_{-1} &gt; 0\\), and \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\). The deterioration in the trade balance is smaller than in the case in which the anticipated productivity shock is permanent, because now the increase in consumption is smaller. In period 1 the trade balance improves:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_1 - tb_0 &= (y_1 - y_0) - (c_1 - c_0) - (i_1 - i_0) \\\\\n&= A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + 2(k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&gt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nIn period 2 the trade balance deteriorates because output falls from \\(A'F(k')\\) to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), and investment goes from negative to zero:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\ntb_2 - tb_1 &= (y_2 - y_1) - (c_2 - c_1) - (i_2 - i_1) \\\\\n&= \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F(k') - (k' - \\bar{k}) \\\\\n&&lt; 0\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nAs we will see shortly, the trade balance in period 2 is lower than in the original steady state. From period 2 on, output is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), consumption is constant and equal to \\(c_0\\), and investment is zero, so the trade balance is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0 &lt; \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1} = tb_{-1} = r\\bar{d}\\). Summarizing,\n\\[\ntb_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nrd_{-1} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\ntb' &lt; rd_{-1} & t = 0 \\\\\ntb'' &gt; tb' & t = 1 \\\\\nrd_{-1} &lt; tb'' & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 &lt; tb_{-1}\\). In period 1, debt falls to a level lower than in the original steady state. To see this, recall that the trade balance is constant from period 2 on, so the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r)d_{t-1} - tb_2, \\quad t \\geq 2\n\\]\nwhich means that the only nonexplosive solution is\n\\[\nd_t = d_1 = tb_2 / r = (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0)/r &lt; (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1})/r = tb_{-1}/r = d_{-1} = \\bar{d},\n\\]\nfor \\(t \\geq 1\\). So we can write\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &lt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0, positive in period 1, and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n-(d'' - d') &gt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n(b)\nThe key diﬀerence is in the trade balance and the current account. Both deteriorate when the temporary shock is anticipated but improve when it is unanticipated. This is primarily because in the former case in period 0 investment increases and output is unchanged, whereas in the latter case investment is unchanged and output increases.\n\n\n(c)\nAn anticipated endowment shock would also cause a deterioration in the trade balance and the current account in period 0, because output is unchanged but consumption increases (as households feel richer). However, the deterioration in the external accounts is smaller, because in the economy with capital investment is a second source of increase in domestic absorption."

First find the intertemporal budget constraint as\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{A_t^{1 - \\alpha} K_t^{\\alpha} + K_t - K_{t + 1} - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = (1 + r) D_{-1}\n\\]\nExpress in terms of \\(k_t\\) and \\(c_t\\):\n\\[\n\\sum_{t = 0}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\gamma^t}{(1 + r)^t} \\left[ k_t^{\\alpha} + k_t - \\gamma k_{t + 1} - c_0 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0\n\\]\nWe know the time path of \\(k_t\\). Therefore the above intertemporal budget constraint represents one equation in one unknown, \\(c_0\\). Solve for \\(c_0\\):\n\\[\nk_0^{\\alpha} + k_0 - \\gamma k_1 + \\frac{\\gamma}{1 + r - \\gamma} \\left[ k_1^{\\alpha} + k_1 - \\gamma k_1 \\right] = (1 + r) D_{-1} / A_0 + \\frac{1 + r}{1 + r - \\gamma} c_0\n\\]\nWith \\(k_0\\) and \\(k_1\\) known, we can solve for \\(c_0\\). We then also have found \\(C_t = \\gamma^t A_0 c_0\\) for all \\(t \\geq 0\\). \\(K_{t+1} = k_1 A_{t+1} = k_1 \\gamma^{t+1} A_0\\) ; \\(Y_t = k_t^{\\alpha} \\gamma^t A_0\\).
