This exercise aims at illustrating the forces determining this variable.\nConsider a two-period world composed of a continuum of countries indexed by \\(i \\in [0, 1]\\).

Households start period 1 with a nil net debt position. In period 1, they can borrow or lend in the international financial market via a debt instrument, denoted \\(d_{i1}\\), that matures in period 2 and carries the interest rate \\(r\\). The interest rate \\(r\\) is exogenous to each country \\(i\\).\nIn period 1, each household receives an endowment of goods \\(y_{i1} = y_1 + \\varepsilon_i\\), where \\(y_1\\) is the world component of the endowment and \\(\\varepsilon_i\\) is a country-specific component satisfying\n\\[\n\\int_0^1 \\varepsilon_i di = 0.\n\\]\nIn period 2, the endowment has no idiosyncratic component and is given by \\(y_{i2} = y_2\\).

    "text": "Problem\nIn Chapter 1, we showed that two empirical regularities that characterize emerging economies are the countercyclicality of the trade balance-to-output ratio and the fact that consumption growth appears to be more volatile than output growth. In this chapter, we developed a simple small open endowment economy and provided intuitive arguments suggesting that this economy fails to account for these two stylized facts. However, that model does not allow for closed-form solutions of second moments of output growth, consumption growth, or the trade balance-to-output ratio. The goal of this exercise is to obtain these implied statistics numerically.\nTo this end, consider the following parameterization of the model developed in the present chapter:\n\\[\ny_t - \\bar{y} = \\rho(y_{t-1} - \\bar{y}) + \\epsilon_t,\n\\]\nwith \\(\\rho=0.9\\), \\(\\bar{y}=1\\), and \\(\\epsilon_t\\) is distributed normally with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.03. Note that the parameter \\(\\bar{y}\\), which earlier in this chapter was implicitly assumed to be zero, represents the deterministic steady state of the output process. Assume further that \\(r=\\frac{1}{\\beta}-1=0.1\\), \\(d_{-1}=\\bar{y}/2\\), and \\(y_{-1}=\\bar{y}\\).\n\nSimulate the economy for 100 years.\nDiscard the first 50 years of artificial data to minimize the dependence of the results on initial conditions.\nCompute the growth rates of output and consumption and the trade balance-to-output ratio.\nCompute the sample standard deviations of output growth and consumption growth and the correlation between output growth and the trade balance-to-output ratio. Here we denote these three statistics by \\(\\sigma_{gy}\\), \\(\\sigma_{gc}\\), and \\(\\rho_{gy,tby}\\), respectively.\nReplicate steps 1 to 4 10,000 times. For each replication, keep record of \\(\\sigma_{gy}\\), \\(\\sigma_{gc}\\), and \\(\\rho_{gy,tby}\\).\nReport the average of \\(\\sigma_{gc} / \\sigma_{gy}\\), and \\(\\rho_{gy,tby}\\) over the 10,000 replications.\nDiscuss your results."

This internalization is absent under external habits, so household consume more in period 1 under the latter formulation.\nIt is of interest to note that period-1 consumption is lower under external habits than under no habits. This is because under external habits, when \\(c_1 = c_2\\), the marginal utility of consumption is higher in period 2 than in period 1, tilting consumption toward the future."

Use (3) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(b_0\\). Then use (5) evaluated at \\(t = 0\\). This gives \\(c_1\\). With \\(b_0\\) and \\(c_1\\) in hand evaluate (3) for \\(t = 1\\) to obtain \\(b_1\\). Continue in this way to construct the sequences \\(\\{c_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\) and \\(\\{b_t\\}_{t=0}^{\\infty}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Equilibrium Paths\n\n\n\n\nEuler equation: \\[\nc_{t+1} = \\beta(1 + r_t)c_t\n\\]\nBudget constraint: \\[\nc_t + \\frac{b_t}{1 + r_t} = y_t + b_{t-1}\n\\]\nClosed-form for \\(c_0\\): \\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\left[ b_{-1} + \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{\\prod_{s=0}^{t-1}(1 + r_s)} \\right) \\right]\n\\] These determine the full equilibrium consumption and asset paths.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nStorage Economy: \\(y = 0\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\).\nPlug these conditions into (5) for both interest rate paths\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta)b_{-1}\n\\]\n\\[\nc'_0 = (1 - \\beta)b_{-1}\n\\]\nand we see that the anticipated rate cut has no effect on consumption today. Now we can plug these expressions into (6) to find the whole consumption paths\n\\[\n\\frac{c'_t}{c_t} =\n\\begin{cases}\n1 & \\text{for all } t \\leq t^* \\\\\n\\left( \\frac{1 + r'_{t^*}}{1 + r_{t^*}} \\right) &lt; 1 & \\text{for all } t &gt; t^*\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nSo the anticipated rate cut leaves current consumption unchanged and lowers future consumption. The rate cut has a substitution effect (SE) whereby current consumption rises and future consumption falls. But it also has an income effect (IE). Here the IE is negative because the positive stock of bonds will pay lower interest rate in the future. With log utility, SE exactly cancels IE effect and the future rate cut fails to stimulate the current economy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Storage Economy\n\n\n\n\nWhen \\(y = 0\\) and \\(b_{-1} &gt; 0\\), then: \\[\nc_0 = c_0' = (1 - \\beta) b_{-1}\n\\]\nSo, \\[\n\\ln \\left( \\frac{c_0'}{c_0} \\right) = 0\n\\]\nThe anticipated interest rate cut has no effect on current consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nEndowment Economy: \\(y_t = y &gt; 0\\) for all \\(t\\) and \\(b_{-1} = 0\\).\nThese conditions we can use (5) to get\n\\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n+ (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=t^*+1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere we discount income at period \\(t\\) to period 0 using \\(q_{0,t}\\), which is simply the product of the interest rate terms. Now with the alternative interest rate path,\n\\[\nc'_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q'_{0,t}} \\right)\n= (1 - \\beta) \\sum_{t=0}^{t^*} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n+ (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r_{t^*}}{1 + r'_{t^*}} \\sum_{t=t^*+1}^{\\infty} \\left( \\frac{y_t}{q_{0,t}} \\right)\n\\]\nwhere we multiply and divide by the new interest rate in period \\(t\\) in order to cancel terms in the product \\(q_{0,t}\\).

Thus, summing up, we have that when \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\), consumption is initially higher than its equilibrium value under the assumption \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\), and then gradually falls to zero at the gross rate \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\).\nIntuitively, households in this economy are impatient relative to the market discount factor \\(1/(1 + r)\\), and, as a result, consume a lot at the beginning and nothing at the â€˜endâ€™ of their never-ending lives. A story similar to that in the 1995 movie Leaving Las Vegas, but in infinite horizon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Consumption Path\n\n\n\n\nConsumption growth: \\[\n\\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\n\\]\nLong-run consumption: \\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0\n\\]\nInitial consumption: \\[\nc_0 = (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y &gt; y\n\\]\nComparison:\n\nWhen \\(\\beta(1 + r) = 1\\), \\(c_t = y\\) for all \\(t\\);\nWhen \\(\\beta(1 + r) &lt; 1\\), consumption starts above \\(y\\) and declines over time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nIn period 0, we have that\n\\[\nd_0 = c_0 - y = \\frac{y}{r} - \\beta \\frac{1 + r}{r} y.\n\\]\nWe calculated before that \\(c_0 &gt; y\\), so we have that \\(d_0 &gt; 0 = d_{-1}\\). Thus, debt increases in period 0.\nNow consider the long run. Taking the limit of the left- and right-hand sides of the sequential resource constraint for \\(t \\to \\infty\\), we get\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = (1 + r) \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t + \\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t - y.\n\\]\nRecalling that \\(\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} c_t = 0\\), we obtain\n\\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = \\frac{y}{r} &gt; d_0.\n\\]\nThe long-run value of debt is higher than its value in period 0. It can be shown that the convergence is monotonic and dictated by the equation\n\\[\nd_t = \\frac{y}{r} \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{t+1} \\right\\}.\n\\]\nThe proof is by induction. We already showed that it holds for \\(t = 0\\), that is,\n\\[\nd_0 = \\left\\{ 1 - [\\beta(1 + r)]^{1+0} \\right\\} \\frac{y}{r}.\n\\]\nSuppose it holds for an arbitrary \\(t \\geq 0\\), then we need to show it also holds for \\(t + 1\\). By the budget constraint:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{t+1} &= (1 + r) d_t + c_{t+1} - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) d_t + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+1} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{1 + r}{r} y - y \\\\\n&= (1 + r) \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+1} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} - y \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+1}(1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r} + \\beta^{t+1} (1 + r)^{t+2} (1 - \\beta) \\frac{y}{r} \\\\\n&= \\left[ 1 - \\beta^{t+2} (1 + r)^{t+2} \\right] \\frac{y}{r}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nSuppose one had been unsure that debt converges to a constant, the above solution for \\(d_t\\) also shows it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Debt Dynamics\n\n\n\n\nInitial debt: \\[\nd_0 = \\left( 1 - \\beta(1 + r) \\right) \\frac{y}{r} &gt; 0\n\\]\nLong-run debt: \\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} d_t = \\frac{y}{r}\n\\]\nDebt increases monotonically and converges to its steady-state level: \\[\nd_t = \\frac{y}{r} \\left[ 1 - (\\beta(1 + r))^{t+1} \\right]\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nThe trade balance is defined as \\(tb_t = y - c_t\\). The initial trade balance is negative, since, as shown above, \\(c_0 &gt; y\\). Since consumption is monotonically decreasing, we have that the trade balance improves monotonically. At some point it turns into a surplus. In the long run, the trade balance equals the endowment \\(y\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Trade Balance Dynamics\n\n\n\n\nTrade balance: \\[\ntb_t = y - c_t\n\\]\nInitially negative since \\(c_0 &gt; y\\)\nImproves monotonically as \\(c_t\\) declines\nEventually turns positive\nLong-run value: \\[\n\\lim_{t \\to \\infty} tb_t = y\n\\]"

Comparing this derivation with the one for an anticipated permanent productivity shock, it is clear that the increase in consumption is now smaller. The trade balance deteriorates in period 0. To see this, write\n\\[\ntb_0 - tb_{-1} = (y_0 - y_{-1}) - (c_0 - c_{-1}) - (i_0 - i_{-1})\n\\]\nand note that \\(y_0 - y_{-1} = 0\\), \\(c_0 - c_{-1} &gt; 0\\), and \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\). The deterioration in the trade balance is smaller than in the case in which the anticipated productivity shock is permanent, because now the increase in consumption is smaller. In period 1 the trade balance improves:\n\\[\ntb_1 - tb_0 = (y_1 - y_0) - (c_1 - c_0) - (i_1 - i_0) = A'F(k') - \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) + 2(k' - \\bar{k}) &gt; 0\n\\]\nIn period 2 the trade balance deteriorates because output falls from \\(A'F(k')\\) to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), and investment goes from negative to zero:\n\\[\ntb_2 - tb_1 = (y_2 - y_1) - (c_2 - c_1) - (i_2 - i_1) = \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - A'F(k') - (k' - \\bar{k}) &lt; 0\n\\]\nAs we will see shortly, the trade balance in period 2 is lower than in the original steady state. From period 2 on, output is constant and equal to* \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k})\\), consumption is constant and equal to \\(c_0\\), and investment is zero, so the trade balance is constant and equal to \\(\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0 &lt; \\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1} = tb_{-1} = r\\bar{d}\\). Summarizing,\n\\[\ntb_t =\n\\begin{cases}\nrd_{-1} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\ntb' &lt; rd_{-1} & t = 0 \\\\\ntb'' &gt; tb' & t = 1 \\\\\nrd_{-1} &lt; tb'' & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe stock of debt increases in period 0. To see this, write*\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_0 &= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_0 \\\\\n&= (1 + r)d_{-1} - tb_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&= d_{-1} - (tb_0 - tb_{-1}) \\\\\n&&gt; d_{-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\nsince \\(tb_0 &lt; tb_{-1}\\). In period 1, debt falls to a level lower than in the original steady state. To see this, recall that the trade balance is constant from period 2 on, so the evolution of debt satisfies\n\\[\nd_t = (1 + r)d_{t-1} - tb_2, \\quad t \\geq 2\n\\]\nwhich means that the only nonexplosive solution is\n\\[\nd_t = d_1 = tb_2 / r = (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_0)/r &lt; (\\bar{A}F(\\bar{k}) - c_{-1})/r = tb_{-1}/r = d_{-1} = \\bar{d}, \\quad \\text{for } t \\geq 1.\n\\]\nSo we can write\n\\[\nd_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n\\bar{d} & t &lt; 0 \\\\\nd' &gt; \\bar{d} & t = 0 \\\\\nd'' &lt; \\bar{d} & t &gt; 0\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThe current account, being the change in the stock of debt, is negative in period 0, positive in period 1, and 0 thereafter,\n\\[\nca_t =\n\\begin{cases}\n0 & t &lt; 0 \\\\\n-(d' - \\bar{d}) &lt; 0 & t = 0 \\\\\n-(d'' - d') &gt; 0 & t = 1 \\\\\n0 & t &gt; 1\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Anticipated Transitory Shock\n\n\n\n\n\\(k_t\\) rises at \\(t=1\\) then falls back at \\(t=2\\)\nInvestment: \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\), \\(i_1 &lt; 0\\), \\(i_t = 0\\) otherwise\nConsumption: rises at \\(t = 0\\), constant thereafter\nTB: worsens at \\(t=0\\), improves at \\(t=1\\), worsens again at \\(t=2\\), then stabilizes\nDebt: \\(d_0 &gt; \\bar{d}\\), \\(d_1 &lt; \\bar{d}\\), \\(d_t = d_1\\) for \\(t \\geq 2\\)\nCA: \\(ca_0 &lt; 0\\), \\(ca_1 &gt; 0\\), \\(ca_t = 0\\) for \\(t \\ne 0, 1\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n(b)\nThe key diï¬€erence is in the trade balance and the current account. Both deteriorate when the temporary shock is anticipated but improve when it is unanticipated. This is primarily because in the former case in period 0 investment increases and output is unchanged, whereas in the latter case investment is unchanged and output increases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal Answer Summary â€“ Anticipated vs.Â Unanticipated Temporary Shock\n\n\n\n\nAnticipated: \\(i_0 &gt; 0\\), \\(y_0\\) unchanged â†’ TB/CA worsen\nUnanticipated: \\(y_0\\) rises, \\(i_0\\) unchanged â†’ TB/CA improve\n\n\n\n\n\n(c)\nAn anticipated endowment shock would also cause a deterioration in the trade balance and the current account in period 0, because output is unchanged but consumption increases (as households feel richer).
