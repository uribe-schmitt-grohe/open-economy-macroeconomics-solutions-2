## Problem

Throughout this chapter, we have studied small open economies in which the world interest rate is given. This exercise aims at illustrating the forces determining this variable.

Consider a two-period world composed of a continuum of countries indexed by $i \in [0, 1]$. Each country is populated by a large number of identical households with preferences given by

$$
\ln(c_{i1}) + \beta \ln(c_{i2}),
$$

where $c_{i1}$ and $c_{i2}$ denote consumption of a perishable good in country $i$ in periods 1 and 2, respectively, and $\beta \in (0, 1)$ is the subjective discount factor. Households start period 1 with a nil net debt position. In period 1, they can borrow or lend in the international financial market via a debt instrument, denoted $d_{i1}$, that matures in period 2 and carries the interest rate $r$. The interest rate $r$ is exogenous to each country $i$.

In period 1, each household receives an endowment of goods $y_{i1} = y_1 + \varepsilon_i$, where $y_1$ is the world component of the endowment and $\varepsilon_i$ is a country-specific component satisfying

$$
\int_0^1 \varepsilon_i di = 0.
$$

In period 2, the endowment has no idiosyncratic component and is given by $y_{i2} = y_2$. Finally, households are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint that forbids them to end period 2 with a positive debt position, that is, they are subject to the constraint $d_{i2} \leq 0$, where $d_{i2}$ denotes the debt assumed in period 2.

1. Write down and solve the household’s optimization problem in country $i$, given $r$.

2. Derive the equilibrium levels of the trade balance, the current account, and external debt in periods 1 and 2 in country $i$ given $r$.

3. Write down the world resource constraints in periods 1 and 2.

4. Derive the equilibrium level of the world interest rate, $r$.

5. Suppose now that output in period 1 in country $i$ increases by $x > 0$, that is, $\Delta y_{i1} = x$. Derive the effect of this shock on the trade balance and the level of external debt in period 1 in country $i$ and on the world interest rate under the following two alternative cases:

    (a) A country-specific endowment shock, $\Delta y_{i1} = \Delta \varepsilon_i = x$ and $\Delta y_1 = 0$.

    (b) A world endowment shock, $\Delta y_{i1} = \Delta y_1 = x$, and $\Delta \varepsilon_i = 0$.

    Provide a discussion of your results.  



## Answer

#### 1.

$$
\max \ln(c_{i1}) + \beta \ln(c_{i2})
$$

subject to:

$$
c_{i1} = y_{i1} + d_{i1}
$$

$$
c_{i2} + (1 + r) d_{i1} = y_{i2}
$$

$$
d_{i2} \leq 0
$$

Note that the last condition should hold with equality. So, using that the debt in the second period is equal to zero, the optimization problem becomes:

$$
\max \ln(c_{i1}) + \beta \ln(c_{i2})
$$

subject to:

$$
c_{i1} = y_{i1} + d_{i1}
$$

$$
c_{i2} + (1 + r) d_{i1} = y_{i2}
$$

Lagrangian:

$$
\mathcal{L} = \ln(c_{i1}) + \beta \ln(c_{i2}) - \lambda_1 (c_{i1} - y_{i1} - d_{i1}) - \lambda_2 (c_{i2} + (1 + r) d_{i1} - y_{i2})
$$

First-order conditions:

$$
\frac{1}{c_{i1}} - \lambda_1 = 0
$$

$$
\frac{\beta}{c_{i2}} - \lambda_2 = 0
$$

$$
\lambda_1 - (1 + r) \lambda_2 = 0
$$

Substituting gives Euler equation:

$$
\frac{1}{c_{i1}} = (1 + r) \beta \frac{1}{c_{i2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_{i2} = c_{i1} (1 + r) \beta
$$

Then using the budget constraints, we obtain:

$$
c_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} + (1 + r) y_{i1})
$$

$$
c_{i2} = \frac{\beta}{1 + \beta} (y_{i2} + (1 + r) y_{i1})
$$

$$
d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r) y_{i1})
$$

- Euler equation:
  $$
  \frac{1}{c_{i1}} = (1 + r)\beta \cdot \frac{1}{c_{i2}} \quad \Rightarrow \quad c_{i2} = (1 + r)\beta \cdot c_{i1}
  $$
- Optimal consumption:
  $$
  c_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} + (1 + r) y_{i1}), \quad
  c_{i2} = \frac{\beta}{1 + \beta} (y_{i2} + (1 + r) y_{i1})
  $$
- Debt:
  $$
  d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r)y_{i1})
  $$

#### 2.

External debt:

$$
d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r) y_{i1}), \quad d_{i2} = 0
$$

Trade balance:

$$
tb_{i1} = y_{i1} - c_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} ( \beta(1 + r) y_{i1} - y_{i2} )
$$

$$
tb_{i2} = y_{i2} - c_{i2} = \frac{1}{1 + \beta} ( y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r) y_{i1} )
$$

Current account:

$$
ca_{i1} = tb_{i1} - r d_{i0} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} ( \beta(1 + r) y_{i1} - y_{i2} )
$$

$$
ca_{i2} = tb_{i2} - r d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} ( y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r) y_{i1} )
$$

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – External Balances"}
- External debt:
  $$
  d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} (y_{i2} - \beta(1 + r) y_{i1}), \quad d_{i2} = 0

- Trade balance:
  $$
  tb_{i1} = y_{i1} - c_{i1}, \quad tb_{i2} = y_{i2} - c_{i2}
  $$

#### 3.

Single country constraints:

$$
c_{i1} = y_{i1} + d_{i1}, \quad c_{i2} + (1 + r) d_{i1} = y_{i2}
$$

Aggregate over all countries:

$$
\int c_{i1} di = \int y_{i1} di + \int d_{i1} di
$$

$$
\int c_{i2} di + (1 + r) \int d_{i1} di = \int y_{i2} di
$$

Bonds are in zero-net supply, so:

$$
\int d_{i1} di = 0
$$

And:

$$
\int y_{i1} di = y_1, \quad \int y_{i2} di = y_2
$$

Therefore:

$$
c_1 = y_1, \quad c_2 = y_2
$$

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – World Resource Constraints"}
- No-aggregate-debt condition:
  $$
  \int d_{i1} \, di = 0
  $$
- Aggregate constraints:
  $$
  \int c_{i1} \, di = y_1, \quad \int c_{i2} \, di = y_2
  $$

From individual optimality condition:

$$
d_{i1} = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} ( y_2 - \beta(1 + r) y_1 )
$$

Integrating:

$$
0 = \frac{1}{(1 + r)(1 + \beta)} ( y_2 - \beta(1 + r) y_1 )
$$

Solving:

$$
r = \frac{y_2}{\beta y_1} - 1
$$

If $y_1 = y_2$, then $(1 + r)\beta = 1$. If $y_1 > y_2$, then $(1 + r)\beta < 1$ ⇒ interest rate falls to encourage less consumption tomorrow.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – Equilibrium Interest Rate"}
- Zero net foreign asset condition:
  $$
  \int d_{i1} \, di = 0
  $$
- Solving yields:
  $$
  r = \frac{y_2}{\beta y_1} - 1
  $$
- Interpretation:
  - If $y_1 = y_2$, then $(1 + r)\beta = 1$
  - If $y_1 > y_2$, then $r$ decreases to encourage intertemporal smoothing

#### 5.

Two cases:

**(a)** Country-specific shock: $\Delta \varepsilon_i = x$, $\Delta y_1 = 0$.

Since world interest rate doesn't depend on idiosyncratic shocks:

$$
r \text{ unchanged}
$$

From above:

$$
d_{i1} = - \frac{\beta \varepsilon_{i1}}{1 + \beta}
$$

So:

$$
\Delta d_{i1} < 0, \quad \Delta tb_{i1} = \Delta ca_{i1} = \frac{\beta \varepsilon_{i1}}{1 + \beta}
$$

Trade balance and current account increase.

**(b)** World shock: $\Delta y_1 = x$, $\Delta \varepsilon_i = 0$.

From world interest rate formula:

$$
r = \frac{y_2}{\beta y_1} - 1 \Rightarrow \Delta y_1 ↑ \Rightarrow r ↓
$$

Substitute $r$ back:

$$
d_{i1} = - \frac{\beta \varepsilon_{i1}}{1 + \beta}
$$

No change in country $i$'s external debt, trade balance, or current account.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – Impact of Endowment Shocks"}
- (a) Country-specific shock:
  - $r$: unchanged
  - $d_{i1}$: decreases
  - $tb_{i1}$ and $ca_{i1}$: increase
- (b) World shock:
  - $r$: decreases
  - $d_{i1}$, $tb_{i1}$, $ca_{i1}$: unchanged
- Comparison:
    - In a world shock, all countries want to save more ⇒ interest rate adjusts;  
    - In a country-specific shock, world interest rate doesn't react ⇒ only affected country adjusts behavior
