## Problem

Consider a small open endowment economy with free capital mobility. Preferences are described by the utility function

$$
- \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_0 \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \beta^t (c_t - c)^2,
$$

where $\beta \in (0, 1)$. Agents have access to a risk-free internationally traded bond paying the constant interest rate $r$, satisfying $\beta(1 + r) = 1$. The representative household starts period zero with the initial debt position $d_{-1}$. Each period $t \geq 0$, the household receives an endowment $y_t$, which obeys the law of motion:

$$
y_t - \bar{y} = \rho(y_{t-1} - \bar{y}) + \varepsilon_{t-1},
$$

where $\varepsilon_{t-1}$ is an i.i.d. shock with mean zero and standard deviation $\sigma_\varepsilon$, $\bar{y} > 0$, and $\rho \in [0, 1)$. Notice that households know already in period $t - 1$ the level of $y_t$ with certainty.

1. Find the equilibrium processes of consumption and the current account.

2. Compute the correlation between the current account and output, $\text{corr}(ca_t, y_t)$. Compare your result with the standard AR(1) case in which $y_t - \bar{y} = \rho(y_{t-1} - \bar{y}) + \varepsilon_t.$

## Answer

#### 1.

The representative household maximizes utility:

$$
\max_{\{c_t\}} - \frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_0 \sum_{t=0}^\infty \beta^t (c_t - c)^2
$$

subject to the budget constraint:

$$
d_t = (1 + r) d_{t-1} + c_t - y_t,
$$

and transversality. With $\beta(1 + r) = 1$, the optimal consumption rule becomes:

$$
c_t = y_t^p - r d_{t-1}
$$

where $y_t^p$ is the annuity value of expected future income:

$$
y_t^p = r \sum_{s=0}^\infty \frac{1}{(1 + r)^s} \mathbb{E}_t[y_{t+s}]
$$

Given anticipated shocks, we have:

$$
\mathbb{E}_t[y_{t+s}] = \bar{y} + \rho^s (y_t - \bar{y})
$$

Therefore,

$$
\begin{aligned}
y_t^p - \bar{y}
&= r \sum_{s=0}^\infty \frac{\rho^s}{(1 + r)^s} (y_t - \bar{y}) \\
&= \frac{r}{1 + r - \rho}(y_t - \bar{y})
\end{aligned}
$$

But since $y_t$ itself is known one period in advance and contains $\varepsilon_{t-1}$, an extra deterministic component arises. Thus:

$$
y_t^p - \bar{y} = \frac{r}{1 + r - \rho}(y_t - \bar{y}) + \frac{r}{1 + r} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + r - \rho} \varepsilon_t
$$

and hence:

$$
c_t = y_t^p - r d_{t-1},
$$

$$
ca_t = y_t - y_t^p
$$

#### 2.

**Standard AR(1):**

With

$$
y_t - \bar{y} = \rho(y_{t-1} - \bar{y}) + \varepsilon_t,
$$

the current account is:

$$
ca_t = \frac{1 - \rho}{1 + r - \rho} (y_t - \bar{y}),
$$

so

$$
\text{corr}(ca_t, y_t) = 1
$$

**Anticipated Shocks:**

Anticipation smooths the income process, reducing surprise and volatility in the current account. After applying covariance algebra, we find:

$$
\text{corr}(ca_t, y_t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 + \left( \frac{r}{1 + r} \right)^2 \cdot \frac{1 - \rho^2}{(1 - \rho)^2}}} < 1
$$
