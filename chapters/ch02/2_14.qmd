## Problem

Consider a perfect-foresight small open economy populated by a large number of identical households with preferences described by the utility function

$$
\min_{t \geq 0} \left\{ \beta^t c_t \right\},
$$

where $c_t$ denotes consumption in period $t$, and $\beta \in (0, 1)$ is a parameter. Households have access to the international financial market, where they can borrow or lend at the constant interest rate $r$. Assume that

$$
\beta(1 + r) = 1 + \gamma,
$$

where $\gamma > 0$ is a parameter. Households are endowed with a constant amount of consumption goods denoted by $y$ each period and start period 0 with a level of debt equal to $d_{-1} > 0$. Finally, households are subject to a no-Ponzi-game constraint of the form

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty}(1 + r)^{-t} d_t \leq 0,
$$

where $d_t$ denotes one-period debt acquired in period $t$ and maturing in $t+1$.

1. Formulate the household’s maximization problem.

2. Write down the complete set of optimality conditions.

3. Characterize the equilibrium paths of consumption and debt in this economy. In particular, express the equilibrium levels of $c_t$ and $d_t$, for $t \geq 0$, in terms of the structural parameters (possibly $\beta$, $r$, $\gamma$, and $y$) and the initial condition $d_{-1}$.

4. What is the equilibrium asymptotic growth rate of the economy’s net asset position? How does it compare to the equilibrium growth rate of consumption?

5. Suppose that in period 0 the economy unexpectedly experiences a permanent increase in the endowment from $y$ to $y + \Delta y$, with $\Delta y > 0$. Derive the impact response of the trade balance. Briefly discuss your result.

6. Characterize the equilibrium under the assumption that $\gamma = 0$.

$$
\max \left\{ \min_{t \geq 0} \left\{ \beta^t c_t \right\} \right\}
$$

subject to

$$
c_t + (1 + r) d_{t-1} = y + d_t \quad \text{(Budget constraint)}
$$

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty}(1 + r)^{-t} d_t \leq 0 \quad \text{(No-Ponzi-game condition)}
$$

$$
d_{-1} > 0 \quad \text{(Initial debt)}
$$

$$
\beta^t c_t = \beta^{t'} c_{t'} \quad \text{for all } t, t' \geq 0.
$$

Intertemporal budget constraint:

$$
(1 + r) d_{-1} = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y - c_t}{(1 + r)^t}
$$

$$
c_t = \beta^{-t} c_0.
$$

Lifetime utility then is

$$
\min_{t \geq 0} \left\{ \beta^t (\beta^{-t} c_0) \right\} = c_0.
$$

Pick $c_0$ so that it satisfies the equilibrium intertemporal budget constraint.

Intermediate steps:

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{y}{(1 + r)^t} = \frac{1 + r}{r} y
$$

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_t}{(1 + r)^t} = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_0}{[\beta(1 + r)]^t} = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{c_0}{(1 + \gamma)^t} = \frac{1 + \gamma}{\gamma} c_0
$$

So the budget constraint becomes:

$$
(1 + r) d_{-1} = \frac{1 + r}{r} y - \frac{1 + \gamma}{\gamma} c_0
$$

Solve for $c_0$:

$$
c_0 = \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right)(y - r d_{-1})
$$

Then for $t \geq 0$:

$$
c_t = \beta^{-t} c_0
$$

To find the path of $d_t$, use:

- At $t = 0$, solve for $d_0$ from the budget constraint using known $c_0$, $y$, and $d_{-1}$;
- At $t = 1$, use $d_0$ and $c_1$ to solve for $d_1$;
- Continue recursively for full $\{d_t\}$ sequence.

- Budget constraint implies:
  $$
  c_0 = \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right)(y - r d_{-1})

The equilibrium intertemporal budget constraint must hold at any $t \geq 0$, so:

$$
c_t = \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right)(y - r d_{t-1})
$$

From the budget constraint:

$$
c_t + (1 + r) d_{t-1} = y + d_t
$$

Rewriting and plugging in $c_t$:

$$
-d_t + d_{t-1} = y - r d_{t-1} - c_t = y - r d_{t-1} - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right)(y - r d_{t-1})
$$

$$
= \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) \right](y - r d_{t-1}) > 0
$$

The bracketed term is positive because $0 < \gamma < r$. Since $y - r d_{-1} > 0$, the current account is initially positive, and debt declines over time.

As $d_t$ falls and turns into assets, asymptotically the growth rate of $-d_t$ is:

$$
\lim_{t \to \infty} \frac{(-d_t) - (-d_{t-1})}{-d_{t-1}} = r \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) \right]
$$

Thus gross growth rate of $-d_t$:

$$
1 + r \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) \right] = \frac{1 + r}{1 + \gamma} < 1 + r
$$

Growth rate of consumption is:

$$
\beta^{-1} = \frac{1 + r}{1 + \gamma}
$$

which matches the growth rate of net assets $-d_t$.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – Growth Rates"}
- Consumption growth: $\frac{c_{t+1}}{c_t} = \beta^{-1} = \frac{1 + r}{1 + \gamma}$
- Net asset growth: identical to consumption growth
- Both grow at rate $< 1 + r$

Step 1: Impact on consumption:

$$
\Delta c_0 = \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) \Delta y < \Delta y
$$

because:

$$
\left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) < 1
$$

(Since $\beta = \frac{1 + \gamma}{1 + r} < 1$)

Step 2: Impact on trade balance:

$$
\Delta tb_0 = \Delta y - \Delta c_0 = \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right) \left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right) \right] \Delta y > 0
$$

Conclusion: a permanent increase in income leads to an increase in the trade balance.

This contrasts with standard time-separable models where trade balance is unchanged. With Leontief preferences and relatively patient agents ($\beta > 1/(1 + r)$), consumption is increasing over time, so to fund this, households save more in $t = 0$.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – Impact of Endowment Shock"}
- $\Delta c_0 < \Delta y$
- $\Delta tb_0 = \left[1 - \left( \frac{\gamma}{1 + \gamma} \right)\left( \frac{1 + r}{r} \right)\right] \Delta y > 0$
- Households save more at $t = 0$ to support growing future $c_t$

#### 6.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – No Equilibrium When $\gamma = 0$"}
- If $\gamma = 0$, then $\beta(1 + r) = 1$
- Utility becomes flat in all $t$, Leontief preferences fail to determine a unique consumption plan
- No well-defined maximum ⇒ no equilibrium
