## Problem

Consider the same economy as in exercise 3.4, except that the interest rate and the subjective discount factor now satisfy

$$
\beta(1 + r) = 1,
$$

and $r > 0$.

1. Characterize the equilibrium dynamics of output, consumption, investment, the trade balance, the current account, and external debt.

2. Does a balanced growth path exist?

3. Considering jointly the results obtained in this exercise and in exercise 3.4, what general conclusion can you derive?


## Answer

#### 1.

The equilibrium conditions are the same, that is, (3.10)–(3.13).

By (3.11), $\Lambda_t = \Lambda_0$ for all $t \geq 0$.  
By (3.10), $C_t = C_0$ for all $t \geq 0$.  
By (3.12)

$$
k_{t+1} = k_1; \quad \text{where } k_1 \text{ solves } r = \alpha k_1^{\alpha - 1}
$$

and

$$
K_{t+1} = A_{t+1} k_1
$$

With the path of $K_t$ in hand, we find the path for

$$
Y_t = A_t^{1 - \alpha} K_t^{\alpha} = A_t k_1^{\alpha}
$$

For $t > 0$, the path of investment is

$$
I_t = K_{t+1} - K_t = A_t (\gamma - 1) k_1
$$

For $t = 0$,

$$
I_0 = A_1 k_1 - K_0 / A_0
$$

To find $C_0$ use the intertemporal budget constraint we derived above

$$
\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \frac{A_t^{1 - \alpha} K_t^{\alpha} + K_t - K_{t+1} - C_t}{(1 + r)^t} = (1 + r) D_{-1}
$$

$$
A_0 (K_0 / A_0)^{\alpha} + K_0 - A_1 k_1 +
\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \frac{A_t [k_1^{\alpha} + k_1 (1 - \gamma)]}{(1 + r)^t}
- \frac{1 + r}{r} C_0 = (1 + r) D_{-1}
$$

$$
A_0 (K_0 / A_0)^{\alpha} + K_0 - A_1 k_1 +
A_0 \cdot \frac{\gamma}{1 + r - \gamma} [k_1^{\alpha} + k_1 (1 - \gamma)] - (1 + r) D_{-1}
= \frac{1 + r}{r} C_0
$$

The trade balance:

$$
TB_t = Y_t - I_t - C_0
$$

How to find the path to $D_t$? We know the path of $Y_t$, $K_t$, $I_t$, and $C_t$. Use the sequential budget constraint (3.9) to construct the path of $D_t$ sequentially. With $D_t$ in hand, find the current account

$$
CA_t = -D_t + D_{t-1}
$$

- Capital: $K_t = A_t k_1$, with $k_1$ solving $r = \alpha k_1^{\alpha - 1}$
- Output: $Y_t = A_t k_1^{\alpha}$ ⇒ grows at rate $\gamma$
- Investment: $I_t = A_t (\gamma - 1) k_1$ for $t > 0$; $I_0 = A_1 k_1 - K_0 / A_0$
- Consumption: $C_t = C_0$ constant ⇒ $c_t = C_t / A_t$ declines over time
- Trade Balance: $TB_t = Y_t - I_t - C_0$
- Debt: solved recursively from sequential budget constraint
- Current Account: $CA_t = -D_t + D_{t-1}$
:::

#### 2.

Balanced growth for $Y_t$, $I_t$, $K_t$, that is, investment and the capital stock grow at the same rate as output.

No balanced growth for consumption, the trade balance, external debt, and the current account.

$$
TB_t = Y_t - I_t - C_0
$$

Consumption does not grow at all. This implies that the consumption-output ratio is not constant over time. In fact, it converges to 0.

The trade balance-to-output ratio is also not constant over time, it converges to

$$
1 - \frac{(\gamma - 1)\alpha}{r} > 0
$$

And the debt-to-output ratio is not constant over time either.  
Since debt is not growing at a constant rate, the current account won’t either.

Therefore, overall no balanced growth path exists.

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – No Balanced Growth Path"}
- $C_t$ is constant, $Y_t$ grows ⇒ $C_t / Y_t \to 0$
- $TB_t / Y_t \to 1 - \frac{(\gamma - 1)\alpha}{r} > 0$
- $D_t / Y_t$ not constant
- $CA_t$ not growing at constant rate
- ⇒ No balanced growth for consumption, TB, debt, or CA
:::

#### 3.

For a balanced growth path for consumption to exist and to be able to express the economy in terms of stationary variables it is necessary that

$$
\beta(1 + r) = \sqrt{\gamma}
$$

or for a general CRRA utility of the form

$$
\frac{c^{1 - \sigma} - 1}{1 - \sigma}
$$

that

$$
\beta(1 + r) = \gamma^{\sigma}
$$

::: {.callout-important title="Final Answer Summary – Condition for Balanced Growth of Consumption"}
- For constant $c_t = C_t / A_t$, require $C_t \propto A_t$
- Necessary condition:  
  $$
  \beta(1 + r) = \sqrt{\gamma}
  $$
- In CRRA case:  
  $$
  \beta(1 + r) = \gamma^{\sigma}
  $$
